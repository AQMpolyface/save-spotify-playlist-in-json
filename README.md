# save-spotify-playlist-in-json

this is a simple go program to save your spotify playlist in a json file. I will make a tool to add them back on another account.

This repo is basically uesless, i just made it to learn git, and golang. 

You have to use an access token. you can get one here: https://developer.spotify.com
fixed it :3

//to do: make better json in the file

you need to have go installed, see => https://go.dev/

 if you wanna run it, you will first have to get a token, then 

git clone https://github.com/AQMpolyface/save-spotify-playlist-in-json.git

cd save-spotify-playlist-in-json

go build playlist.go


go run playlist.go -t "your_token"

or you can put the token if a file called token, in the same directory as the playlist.go file.

I FIXED IT (i think) 
got banned for 8 houres from the spotify api, will try to see if it work tomorrow
