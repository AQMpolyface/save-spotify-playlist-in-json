# save-spotify-playlist-in-json

this is a simple go program to save your spotify playlist in a json file. I will make a tool to add them back on another account.

This repo is basically uesless, i just made it to learn git, and golang. 

You have to use an access token. you can get one here: https://developer.spotify.com

I have no clue if it works, cuz right now the spotify api for the track doesnt work, i get a 502 error.
