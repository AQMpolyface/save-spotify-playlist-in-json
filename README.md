this is a simple go program to save your spotify playlist in a json file. I will make a tool to add them back on another account.

This repo is basically uesless, i just made it to learn git, and golang.

You have to use an access token. you can get one here: https://developer.spotify.com

you need to have go installed, see => https://go.dev/

if you wanna run it, you will first have to get a token, then

```

git clone https://github.com/AQMpolyface/save-spotify-playlist-in-json.git

cd save-spotify-playlist-in-json

go run playlist.go -t "your_token"
```

i hosted it on my website. you can run this tool online on https://polyface.ch/projects/playlistjson


(you still need a token, but the website is open source so you can see that i am not doing anything spooky with your data)
